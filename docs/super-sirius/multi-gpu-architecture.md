# Multi-GPU Architecture

How Sirius executes SQL across every GPU on a single node — the components, data residency model, scheduling rules, and concurrency invariants.

## The Mental Model

Sirius treats a multi-GPU host as a set of cooperating execution units that share host memory and disk but have private device memory. The engine's job is to:

1. **Place data** so that each row lives in the GPU (or NUMA host region, or local disk) closest to where it will be consumed
2. **Place tasks** so each task runs on the GPU that already holds its inputs
3. **Move data when locality fails** — across GPUs via peer DMA (or host-staging when peer DMA is broken), to host or disk on memory pressure, and back to GPU when the next task needs it

The user writes plain SQL. The Sirius optimizer extension intercepts the physical plan and routes supported operators to the multi-GPU execution path; unsupported plans fall back to DuckDB's CPU engine transparently.

```sql
-- Plain SQL — transparently routed to multi-GPU execution
LOAD 'sirius.duckdb_extension';
SELECT l_returnflag, SUM(l_quantity) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_returnflag;
```

The engine assumes a single process pinning the configured subset of visible GPUs
(`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` bounds which GPUs Sirius can use; `sirius.topology` selects from that
set). There is no notion of distributed multi-node execution in this codebase.

## Tier Hierarchy

Every byte of data lives in exactly one **memory tier** at any moment. Tiers, fastest to slowest:

| Tier | Backed by | Capacity per host | Typical purpose |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `GPU` | `cuda_async_memory_resource` (one pool per device) | Bounded by GPU device memory × `usage_limit_fraction` | Active query data |
| `HOST` | NUMA-local pinned host memory | Set by config: `memory.host.capacity_bytes` (per NUMA host memory resource) | Downgrade target when GPU is full |
| `DISK` | On-disk file pool via cucascade's `idisk_io_backend` | Configured via `set_disk_mounting_point(gpu_id, capacity, path)` | Last-resort downgrade target |

`HOST` is partitioned by NUMA node — each GPU has a paired host region on its NUMA-local memory controller for fast downgrade. This is configured via `cucascade::memory::reservation_manager_configurator::use_host_per_gpu()` at startup.

Conceptually:

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│  GPU 0  │  │  GPU 1  │  │  GPU 2  │  │  GPU 3  │  ← Tier::GPU
└────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘
     └─────┬──────┘            └─────┬──────┘
           │                         │
      ┌────┴────┐               ┌────┴────┐
      │ Host    │               │ Host    │
      │ (NUMA0) │               │ (NUMA1) │      ← Tier::HOST (per-NUMA, shared by sibling GPUs)
      └────┬────┘               └────┬────┘
           └─────────────┬───────────┘
                    ┌────┴────┐
                    │  Disk   │                  ← Tier::DISK (shared pool)
                    └─────────┘
```

A `cucascade::memory::memory_space` is the in-memory representation of one (tier, gpu_id) pair. The engine queries spaces via `manager.get_memory_space(Tier, gpu_id)` and routes allocations through that space's `device_async_resource_ref`. Each space owns its allocator and a `reservation_aware_resource_adaptor` that tracks per-thread byte budgets so OOM is detectable before the driver fails.

## Component Diagram

A single `SiriusContext` per process owns the entire multi-GPU machinery. Its key fields:

```

Ownership goes one direction: `SiriusContext` owns everything below it. Connections register `sirius_state` (a `shared_ptr<SiriusContext>`) into DuckDB's `ClientContext::registered_state` at `OnConnectionOpened`, and remove it at `OnConnectionClosed`.

## Per-GPU Initialization

`SiriusContext::initialize()` is the single point where multi-GPU state comes online. The sequence (`src/sirius_context.cpp`):

1. **Discover GPUs.** `topology_discovery` enumerates devices visible to the process (respects `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`), and records each GPU's NUMA node. A NUMA node the OS cannot resolve stays `-1` ("unknown") — the sentinel is carried through rather than normalized to node 0, and consumers fall back explicitly (e.g. the first host space) when they meet it.
2. **Build the topology index.** After the memory manager is populated, `initialize()` builds one immutable `sirius::memory::topology_index` (`src/include/memory/topology_index.hpp`) — the single NUMA↔GPU map — and injects it (as `shared_ptr<const>`) into the `task_creator`, the `sirius_scan_manager`, the NUMA-aware small pinned host resource, and the per-GPU downgrade configs (`numa_node_of(device_id)`). `terminate()` resets it. Locality decisions all route through `topology_index::gpus_of()` / `numa_node_of()` rather than component-private maps.
3. **Build memory spaces.** A `reservation_manager_configurator` is configured with per-GPU usage limits, per-host capacities, optional disk mounts, and NUMA pairings. `builder.build()` produces `memory_space_config`s, which `sirius_memory_reservation_manager` consumes to construct all tier × gpu spaces.
4. **Install per-GPU device resource refs.** For each GPU, `sirius_memory_reservation_manager`'s constructor sets that GPU's `cuda_async_memory_resource` as cudf's `current_device_resource_ref` (saving the previous ref for restoration on shutdown). This ensures cudf operations on each GPU allocate through that GPU's reservation-tracked pool.
5. **Construct the scan manager and its local ioctx.** The scan manager creates one `uring_ioctx` for local files. Its reactor pool accepts device-read requests for any visible GPU.
6. **Register the path-routed backends.** The scan manager's `io_context_registry` holds one entry per backend type (`uring` / `restful` / `kvikio`), each a path checker and a factory. A REST ioctx for `s3://` is built on first use and shared by all GPUs.
7. **Restore cudf device-resource refs on shutdown.** `sirius_memory_reservation_manager`'s destructor first synchronizes each managed GPU (`cudaDeviceSynchronize()`) so pending `cudaFreeAsync` operations against the soon-to-be-destroyed pool complete, then restores cudf's previous device resource ref. The sync step is critical — without it, tests that leave async deallocations un-synchronized can corrupt the driver's per-device pool list and crash the next manager construction on the same device.

After `initialize()`, the engine has per-GPU memory pools, shared backend-specific I/O reactor pools, path-based datasource routing, and a manager that translates `(Tier, gpu_id)` into an allocator.

## Data Residency: Pin Tables

Tables that benefit from being resident in GPU memory get **pinned** via the SQL surface:

```sql
CALL pin_table('lineitem');                    -- distribute chunks across GPU memory spaces (default)
CALL pin_table('lineitem', tier => 'host');    -- pin into host memory only
```

The pin pipeline (`src/pin_table.cpp`, `src/scan_manager/`):

1. **Open the parquet files.** `PinTableFunction` reads every file of the pin through the scan manager's ioctx.
2. **Enumerate and coalesce.** Parquet metadata yields row groups. The coalescer bundles them into batches sized to `scan_task_batch_size`. A large file spans several batches; small files share one.
3. **Distribute round-robin per batch.** `round_robin_strategy` assigns each batch the next GPU memory space from an atomic cursor. The unit is a batch, so one file's row groups can land on different GPUs. Each pin call starts the round-robin cursor at 0. Identical batch sequences therefore produce the same device sequence. Batch boundaries depend on the projected column set, so pinning the same table with different columns can slice it differently. The merge path rejects different batch layouts.
4. **Materialize each batch into its target space.** The pin path makes the target GPU current (`cuda_set_device_raii`), takes a stream from that GPU's memory space, and passes the space's allocator to `read_parquet`. The decoded columns land on the owning GPU.
5. **Record the pinned entry.** `pinned_entry { data_batches_by_column, chunk_memory_spaces }` is stored on the `sirius_scan_manager`. The `chunk_memory_spaces` vector is parallel to `data_batches_by_column[col_idx]` — `chunk_memory_spaces[i]` is the owning space for chunk `i` regardless of which column you're looking at.

Repeat invocations of `pin_table('lineitem', ...)` are idempotent — duplicates dropped, existing `chunk_memory_spaces` preserved (Phase 22 Pitfall 3 invariant: any merge must verify `chunk_memory_spaces` integrity).

When the HOST-tier pinning path is used (`2e197c6` upstream feature, integrated in Phase 24), `pin_table` builds one `cucascade::host_data_representation` per batch on the host space NUMA-local to the GPU that produced it, and stores them in `pinned_entry::host_chunks`. It falls back to the first host space when the GPU's NUMA node is unknown or no matching host space exists; subsequent scans go through the cached provider in host mode, which slices the host chunks per query and converts back to GPU only when a scan task starts. When pin-table compression is enabled, individual host chunks may be `compressed_host_representation` instead (and GPU-tier compressed storage lives in `device_chunks`), with per-chunk dispatch at serve time — see [Compressed Pinning](compressed-pinning.md).

The two tiers record placement differently. A GPU-tier entry fills `chunk_memory_spaces`. A HOST-tier entry leaves it empty and keeps per-chunk placement in each `host_data_representation`. `pinned_entry::memory_space` is metadata for a host entry, and the MVCC mask path expands it into a uniform vector. Serve-time validation of `chunk_memory_spaces` runs on the GPU tier only.

## Scan-Time: Routing to the Right GPU

When a query selects from a pinned table, `cached_databatch_provider` walks `pinned_entry`'s chunks. For each chunk:

1. **Attach the chunk's recorded memory space** to the emitted batch: `chunk_memory_spaces[i]` on the GPU tier, the chunk's host representation on the HOST tier. The provider sets no device id.
2. **`task_creator` derives `preferred_device_id`** from that memory space. A GPU-tier space yields its own device id. A HOST-tier space yields a NUMA-local GPU, round-robin across the GPUs on that node.
3. **The scheduler routes the task** to that GPU's worker thread.

GPU-tier chunks run on their owning GPU without a peer copy. HOST-tier chunks are copied to a NUMA-local GPU when the task starts. `task_creator` applies this rule last, after upstream-split, partition-pin, and byte-locality preferences.

## Task Scheduling: Ready Devices and Locality

For tasks that aren't bound to a specific chunk (e.g., downstream operators consuming many input batches), the task creator computes a **locality score**:

```
locality(task, gpu_id) = bytes of task input data already on gpu_id
```

The task creator records the selected device as `preferred_device_id`, falling back to the task's NUMA-paired GPU if locality is tied or all data is on HOST. The scheduler then matches tasks to GPU executors that have signaled readiness: it first looks for a task preferring that exact GPU, then for a task with no preference. A preference is binding; a preference-less task may be claimed by any ready GPU. There is no round-robin ordering guarantee in the scheduler matcher.

The task creator resolves a task's `preferred_device_id` in priority order:

1. **Upstream input-data preference** — a fresh-read scan split carries the device the scan manager stamped onto it.
2. **Partition device pin** (see below) — partitioned operator inputs.
3. **Data-locality by bytes** — the GPU already holding the most of the task's input bytes.
4. **NUMA-affinity** — when all input lives on HOST, a GPU on the same NUMA node (round-robin when that NUMA hosts several GPUs).

Two-level `preferred_device_id`:

- `gpu_pipeline_task_local_state::_preferred_device_id` — per-task override (winner)
- `sirius_pipeline_task_global_state::_preferred_device_id` — pipeline-level default

`task->get_preferred_device_id()` checks local first, falls back to global.

See [`pipeline-execution.md`](pipeline-execution.md) "Per-task-device contract under SCHED-RR" for the deeper contract.

### Partition device pin for cuco-backed operators

Partitioned operators — BUILD_PROBE hash join, `grouped_aggregate_merge`, and the other partition-keyed operators — build a per-partition cuco hash table that is **only valid on the GPU it was built on**. A stream bound to GPU A that touches a cuco counter built under GPU B trips `cudaErrorInvalidValue` in cuco's `counter_storage`. The device a partition runs on is therefore a **correctness constraint, not just a locality preference**: every task of a given partition (its build and all its probes) must land on the same GPU.

The task creator enforces this by pinning any task whose input is a `partitioned_operator_data` to `partition_idx % num_active_gpus`. The index is taken over the **admitted GPU set** — `task_creator::_active_gpu_ids`, which starts as the device ids that actually have a GPU executor (from the memory manager's `Tier::GPU` memory spaces, the same set `task_scheduler` keys executors on) and is narrowed per query by `sirius_engine::initialize_internal` via `set_active_gpu_ids()`. Indexing this set, rather than the physical hardware topology, covers both a configured GPU count smaller than the physical count and a query admitted onto only a subset of executors (`topology.gpus_per_query`). A task that reached the scheduler pinned to a device without an executor would remain queued indefinitely because preferences are binding; deriving and clamping preferences against the admitted set prevents such phantom or excluded-device pins.

The pin also survives OOM reschedule. When a partitioned task OOMs and is rebuilt with a fresh `local_state`, the per-task `preferred_device_id` is carried forward; without it the rescheduled task would demote to "no preference" and scatter. (A pin held on the pipeline-level global state already survives reconstruction, so only the local-state pin needs to be copied.)

## Cross-GPU Data Movement

When an operator must consume data on GPU A that lives on GPU B (e.g., a hash join's probe side has chunks scattered across all GPUs), `lock_or_prepare_batch` (`src/include/pipeline/batch_lock_utils.hpp`) **clones the batch into the consumer's memory space under a shared (read) lock** via `read_only_data_batch::clone_to`. The source batch is never exclusively locked and never mutated: it stays resident on GPU B for consumers local to that device, concurrent readers proceed during the transfer, and the source drops back to the idle state as soon as the prepare completes — making it immediately downgrade-eligible. Source lifetime is ownership-driven: repositories and other tasks holding the batch keep it alive, and the consuming task releases its own pin on the original right after prepare, so a single-consumer source is freed as soon as its clone exists. The clone's allocation is charged to the consuming task's memory reservation, and the reservation estimator counts GPU inputs residing in a different memory space in `bytes_to_materialize_input`.

Host- and disk-resident inputs intentionally keep **move semantics**: `lock_or_prepare_batch` upgrades them to the GPU in place, freeing the spilled copy — the common case is a single consumer re-materializing a downgraded batch.

The underlying byte transfer is `cucascade::convert_gpu_to_gpu` (in `cucascade/src/data/representation_converter.cpp`), which waits on the source's writer event and synchronizes its copy stream before returning, so the clone is complete when `clone_to` returns. The transfer chooses one of two paths empirically:

1. **Direct peer DMA** (`cudaMemcpyPeerAsync`) — fastest, used when `probe_peer_dma_works(src, dst)` returns true. Real peer access requires both GPUs to have driver-level P2P enabled AND the hardware to actually honor it.
2. **Host-staging** (`cudaMemcpyAsync(DtoH)` → host buffer → `cudaMemcpyAsync(HtoD)`) — fallback for hardware where peer DMA is empirically broken (e.g., the consumer-grade RTX 6000 Ada we use for development, which advertises P2P but silently fails DMA in both directions).

The probe runs once at startup per (src, dst) pair: allocate small buffers on each device, attempt a `cudaMemcpyPeerAsync` and a roundtrip read-back. If the bytes don't match, mark the pair as host-stage-required.

**Concurrency invariants for cross-GPU transfers:**

- **Same-stream invariant** (Phase 22 Cluster B): Both the DtoH and HtoD copies in the host-staging path must execute on the **same** `target_stream`. Using different streams was the cause of a race that intermittently corrupted output at SF100 Q11 — closed by collapsing producer + DtoH leg + HtoD leg onto a single stream in `alloc_and_peer_copy_async`.
- **Device-context propagation** (Phase 23 Plan 23-06): The HtoD `cudaMemcpyAsync` in `alloc_and_peer_copy_async` is wrapped in an `rmm::cuda_set_device_raii dst_guard{rmm::cuda_device_id{dst_device}}` so the destination device's CUDA context is active during the copy. The outer `convert_gpu_to_gpu`'s `target_guard` does not propagate through `reconstruct_column_p2p` → `alloc_and_peer_copy_async`; the inner guard fixes a `cudaErrorInvalidValue` on broken-peer-DMA hardware.
- **Probe device-context restore** (Phase 23 Plan 23-07): `run_p2p_probe_locked` ends with a paired `cudaSetDevice` to restore the caller's device context, not a hardcoded `cudaSetDevice(0)` which would clobber the caller's RAII guard.

## Multi-GPU-Safe Parquet I/O

Multi-GPU parquet reads, local and `s3://`, stay **off kvikio**. The registry still carries a kvikio catch-all for paths no explicit backend claims; the config below keeps local parquet from falling through to it. The reasoning: cudf's bundled `file_source` factory uses kvikio, which binds the file handle to whichever CUDA context was active at construction time. In multi-GPU execution that's a hidden source of corruption — a file_handle bound to GPU 0 will silently funnel reads through GPU 0 even when the consumer is on GPU 1. `sirius_config::enforce_sirius_datasource_for_multi_gpu()` therefore forces `scan_manager_config::use_sirius_datasource = true` whenever more than one GPU memory space is configured, and emits a warning if the user-supplied value was `false`.

Single-GPU configurations may still opt out via `use_sirius_datasource=false`; the per-FileHandle context binding is harmless with only one CUDA context in play. With that setting, local paths resolve to `kvikio_context` instead of `uring_ioctx`. Reads still use the `sirius_datasource` interface; the kvikio backend delegates to cuDF's datasource. The rest of this section describes the multi-GPU (`use_sirius_datasource=true`) path.

The Sirius path:

1. **Managed file reads go through `ioctx::open_datasource(path)`.** Never `cudf::io::datasource::create(path)` and never `cudf::io::source_info{path}`. With single-GPU `use_sirius_datasource=false`, local parquet takes the cudf-bundled path instead.
2. **An ioctx is shared across GPUs.** The ioctx and its reactors bind no device at construction. A device read captures the caller's current CUDA device at dispatch and carries it on the request. The reactor makes that device current for the H2D copy, and holds copy events for every visible device.
3. **Paths are resolved through `io_context_registry`.** The registry runs each backend's path checker and returns a backend type. Uring's checker is a filesystem stat, applied after the scan manager strips a leading `file://`. Local files use the shared uring ioctx, `s3://` the REST ioctx. A kvikio catch-all claims what no explicit backend takes. A null datasource means the resolved backend's factory declined to construct, for example an unconfigured object store.
4. **Pin-table placement is carried by `memory_space`.** All files of a pin go through the same ioctx. The destination GPU comes from the current-device guard and the target space's allocator, and is recorded per chunk for task creation.

Every managed read on the multi-GPU path resolves through `ioctx::open_datasource` — the unified `sirius_gpu_scan_operator`, the split providers, `sirius_extension`, and the pin path all route through it. Local parquet reaches `cudf::io::datasource::create(path)` only under the single-GPU `use_sirius_datasource=false` opt-out. The kvikio catch-all still serves paths no explicit backend claims. The parquet reader wraps sirius datasources through the `datasource*` overload.

## Memory Pressure: Reservations and Downgrade

Every allocation through a `memory_space`'s default allocator goes through a `reservation_aware_resource_adaptor` that:

1. **Tracks bytes per-thread.** Per-thread budget is established via `attach_reservation_to_tracker(stream, reservation)`. The reservation tells the adaptor how many bytes this stream can claim before raising `rmm::out_of_memory`.
2. **Throws on OOM instead of segfaulting.** `do_allocate` calls `upstream->allocate`, which throws `rmm::out_of_memory` when the pool can't satisfy. The OOM unwinds back to `gpu_pipeline_task::execute`, which catches it and raises `oom_reschedule_exception`.
3. **Records OOM peak to `pipeline_memory_history`.** Subsequent estimates of the same operator's peak memory consult the history; the scheduler uses these estimates to size reservations and to decide whether to schedule a task or wait for a downgrade.

On OOM the engine triggers a **downgrade**:

- The `downgrade_executor` monitors per-tier memory pressure. When a tier crosses its threshold, it picks candidate batches (LRU within the tier) and converts them to the next-cheaper tier (`GPU` → `HOST`, `HOST` → `DISK`).
- Downgrades are stream-ordered: `cudaFreeAsync` on the source tier, then `cudaMallocFromPoolAsync` + memcpy on the target tier. The new tier's `memory_space` becomes the batch's owning space.
- Phase 22.2 K.6 fix: the executor only calls `cudaSetDevice` when its `_space_id.tier == GPU`. HOST-tier downgrade workers operate on host memory only — calling `cudaSetDevice(-1)` for a HOST-tier `space_id` was the K.6 SIGSEGV root cause.

After a downgrade frees enough space, the rescheduled task retries. The reservation tracking ensures the same task doesn't try to allocate more bytes than its reservation; if the reservation itself can't grow, the task fails out of the pipeline.

## Concurrency Invariants (Quick Reference)

| Invariant | Where enforced | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Same-stream for DtoH+HtoD in `alloc_and_peer_copy_async` | `cucascade/src/data/representation_converter.cpp` | Prevents Phase 22 Cluster B race seen at SF100 Q11 |
| `dst_guard` around HtoD memcpy in `alloc_and_peer_copy_async` | Same file (Phase 23 fix) | Outer `target_guard` doesn't propagate through `reconstruct_column_p2p`; broken-peer-DMA hardware needs the inner guard |
| `run_p2p_probe_locked` restores caller's device context on exit | `cucascade/src/memory/common.cpp` (Phase 23 fix) | Probe was hardcoding `cudaSetDevice(0)`, clobbering caller's RAII guard |
| `cudaDeviceSynchronize` per GPU before `cudaMemPoolDestroy` | `src/memory/sirius_memory_reservation_manager.cpp` (post-Phase-24 fix) | Pending `cudaFreeAsync` against a soon-destroyed pool corrupts the driver's per-device pool list |
| A device read carries the caller's device id; the reactor sets that device for the H2D copy | `src/include/io/templated_ioctx.hpp`, `src/include/io/io_request.hpp` | The ioctx is shared across GPUs. Copying without setting the device lands the bytes on whichever GPU the reactor thread happens to have current |
| `_per_thread_init` in `downgrade_executor` gated on `tier == GPU` | `src/downgrade/downgrade_executor.cpp` (Phase 22.2 K.6) | HOST-tier workers must not call `cudaSetDevice(-1)` |
| `chunk_memory_spaces[i]` parallel to `data_batches_by_column[col][i]` | `src/include/scan_manager/sirius_scan_manager.hpp` | Pin-table merge must preserve owning-space per chunk (Phase 22 Pitfall 3) |
| All tasks of a partition pinned to one admitted GPU via `partition_idx % _active_gpu_ids.size()`; pin preserved across OOM reschedule | `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`, `src/pipeline/gpu_pipeline_executor.cpp` | A cuco hash table is valid only on the GPU it was built on; cross-device access trips `cudaErrorInvalidValue`. Indexing the admitted executor set avoids phantom pins when `num_gpus` < physical GPU count, and keeps a query off devices it was not admitted onto |
| Locality-derived device preferences (operator hint, GPU-resident bytes, NUMA `gpus_of()`, cached-chunk home) clamped into `_active_gpu_ids` | `src/creator/task_creator.cpp` | These are computed from where data lives, not from the admitted set, so any of them can name an excluded device — and the scheduler treats a preference as binding |
| HYG-02 invariant: 0 new `rmm::cuda_stream_default` in `src/` outside `legacy/` | grep gate | Default-stream usage breaks per-task-device contract under SCHED-RR |
| Multi-GPU parquet reads resolve to `sirius_datasource`, not kvikio | `sirius_config::enforce_sirius_datasource_for_multi_gpu()` forces `use_sirius_datasource=true` when >1 GPU is configured | Any file-path datasource via cudf silently uses kvikio, which binds to a single CUDA context |

## Hardware Caveats

- **Consumer-grade GPUs (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada Generation)** may advertise P2P peer access via `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` but silently fail actual DMA transfers. The empirical probe (`probe_peer_dma_works`) catches this at startup and routes affected pairs through host-staging.
- **NUMA topology discovery** runs at startup. The `topology_discovery` component reads `/sys/class/drm/card*/device/numa_node` (and equivalents) to determine each GPU's NUMA node, then pairs each GPU with its NUMA-local host region. Without this, host-tier downgrade traffic crosses the NUMA boundary, halving effective bandwidth.
- **`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`** scopes which GPUs Sirius may use. With the automatic topology
  default, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` enables both visible GPUs. Set `sirius.topology.num_gpus` to
  use only a prefix of that visible set, or use `gpu_ids` to select a non-prefix subset.
- **Single-process scope.** Sirius runs as a single OS process. Multi-process / multi-node execution is out of scope; the user is responsible for partitioning at a higher layer if needed.
