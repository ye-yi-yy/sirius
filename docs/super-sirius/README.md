# Super Sirius Documentation

Super Sirius is the new task-based GPU execution engine in Sirius. It uses `namespace sirius` and replaces the legacy `gpu_processing` path with a pipelined, multi-threaded architecture that partitions work across GPU and CPU thread pools.

With a Sirius config file (`~/.sirius/sirius.yaml`), GPU execution is **transparent** — users write plain SQL and supported queries automatically execute on the GPU. Unsupported queries silently fall back to CPU. The explicit `CALL gpu_execution('...')` function is still available but no longer required. Legacy `sirius.cfg` is still recognized for compatibility.

```sql
-- Just load the extension. If ~/.sirius/sirius.yaml exists, GPU is automatic.
LOAD 'sirius.duckdb_extension';

-- Plain SQL — transparently executed on GPU:
SELECT l_returnflag, SUM(l_quantity) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_returnflag;
```

## How It Differs from Legacy Sirius

| Aspect | Legacy (`gpu_processing`) | Super Sirius |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Namespace | `duckdb` | `sirius` |
| Entry point | `CALL gpu_processing(...)` | Plain SQL (transparent) or `CALL gpu_execution(...)` |
| Plan generator | `GPUPhysicalPlanGenerator` | `sirius_physical_plan_generator` |
| Operators | `GPUPhysicalOperator` in `src/operator/` | `sirius_physical_operator` in `src/op/` |
| Execution model | Single-threaded GPU executor | Multi-pipeline task-based execution |
| Memory management | `GPUBufferManager` | cuCascade tiered memory (GPU/Host/Disk) |
