Sirius is a GPU-Native Composable Analytics Engine. It plugs into existing databases via the standard Substrait query format, requiring no query rewrites or major system changes. Sirius currently supports DuckDB and Starrocks (coming soon), other systems marked with \* are on our roadmap. Built on NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries including cuDF, cuVS, and cuCascade, Sirius delivers high-performance GPU-accelerated analytics.

## Performance

TPC-H hot runs on AWS, 22 queries · best Sirius g7e size vs DuckDB on m9g.16xlarge · cost per run, log scales · lower left is better.

![TPC-H hot-run query time and cost per run on AWS: Sirius versus DuckDB](super-sirius-perf.png)

## Requirements
- Linux on amd64/x86_64 or arm64/aarch64 with `glibc >= 2.28`.
- NVIDIA Turing or newer, with compute capability 7.5+.
- CUDA 13.x (driver 580.65.06 or newer) or CUDA 12.x (driver 525.60.13 or newer).
- `io_uring` enabled at runtime (`CONFIG_IO_URING`, `kernel.io_uring_disabled=0` recommended). Containers must allow `io_uring_setup`, `io_uring_enter`, and `io_uring_register`.
- Local Parquet files should be on a filesystem/block device that supports direct I/O (`O_DIRECT`).

### Build Requirements

- Git (to clone the repo)
- Pixi (install instructions [here](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/))

## Building and Running Sirius

For full build instructions, alternate build types, pre-commit setup, and testing, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Quick start:

```bash
git clone --no-recurse-submodules https://github.com/sirius-db/sirius.git
cd sirius
git submodule update --init --depth=1 --jobs 3 duckdb substrait cucascade
pixi run make TEST_BUILD_TARGET=
./build/release/duckdb
```

Alternatively, load the extension into an existing DuckDB shell:

```sql
LOAD 'build/release/extension/sirius/sirius.duckdb_extension';
```

Either way, all DuckDB queries are automatically intercepted by the optimizer hook and run on GPU — no query rewrites required. Queries with unsupported operators fall back silently to CPU.

```sql
-- Plain SQL runs on GPU automatically
SELECT l_returnflag, sum(l_quantity)
FROM lineitem
GROUP BY l_returnflag
ORDER BY l_returnflag;

-- Disable transparent GPU execution for this connection
SET gpu_execution = false;
-- ... or for every connection of this database instance without a session value
SET GLOBAL gpu_execution = false;
```

Execution is out-of-core with tiered memory management (GPU/host/disk), automatic data partitioning, and spilling, and works with both **Parquet** and **DuckDB-native** storage. See [`gpu_execution`](gpu_execution.md) for build, configuration, and testing details.

## Python API

Use Sirius through DuckDB's Python API: load the extension, execute SQL, and fetch results.
Supported queries run on the GPU automatically, just as they do in the DuckDB shell.

After building Sirius above, run these commands from the repository root to build the Python
package against the same DuckDB source as the extension:

```bash
git submodule update --init --depth=1 duckdb-python
pixi run -e duckdb-python build-duckdb-python
```

Save this example as `example.py` in the repository root and replace `/path/to/lineitem.parquet`
with your TPC-H Parquet file. `allow_unsigned_extensions` allows loading the locally built
extension.

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect(":memory:", config={"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"})
con.execute("""
    CREATE VIEW lineitem AS
    SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/path/to/lineitem.parquet')
""")

con.execute("LOAD 'build/release/extension/sirius/sirius.duckdb_extension'")
rows = con.execute("""
    SELECT l_returnflag, SUM(l_quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM lineitem
    GROUP BY l_returnflag
    ORDER BY l_returnflag
""").fetchall()

print(rows)
con.close()
```

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
pixi run -e duckdb-python python example.py
```

For an example using TPC-H data from Parquet files or a DuckDB database, see the
[Python benchmark script](../test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py).

## Pinning Tables for Hot Runs

Sirius reads table data from storage on every query. For the best hot-run performance, pin
frequently queried tables: `pin_table` materializes a table's columns into memory once, and
subsequent queries over that source are served straight from the pinned copy, skipping file
I/O and decode entirely. Queries don't change — pinned tables are matched automatically.

```sql
-- Pin a parquet file (or glob) into GPU memory; omit cols to pin all columns
CALL pin_table('/path/to/lineitem.parquet', name = 'lineitem', tier = 'gpu',
               cols = ['l_orderkey', 'l_quantity', 'l_extendedprice', 'l_shipdate']);

-- Pin a DuckDB base table
CALL pin_table(format = 'duckdb', name = 'my_table', tier = 'gpu');

-- Served from the pinned copy — no file I/O
SELECT sum(l_extendedprice * l_quantity)
FROM read_parquet('/path/to/lineitem.parquet')
WHERE l_shipdate >= DATE '1994-01-01';

-- Release the pinned memory
CALL unpin_table('lineitem');
```

`tier = 'gpu'` pins columns in GPU memory for the fastest scans; `tier = 'host'` pins them in
pinned host memory instead, for tables larger than GPU memory.

Deletes and committed inserts on pinned DuckDB tables are reconciled per query. `UPDATE`,
`MERGE ... UPDATE`, and `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` are rejected while the target table is
pinned; run `CALL unpin_table(...)` before updating it. An explicit `CHECKPOINT` while a pin is
live makes that pin ineligible to serve: subsequent queries fall back or error until the table is
unpinned and pinned again.

### Compression with Simpatico

Sirius can use Simpatico to compress pinned data in GPU or host memory. After loading Sirius,
set both compression options **before** calling `pin_table`. This example runs from the
repository root and uses the bundled TPC-H SF1000 compression plans:

```sql
SET pin_table_compression = true;
SET pin_table_input_compression_plan_dir = 'src/compression/simpatico_codegen/plans/tpch_sf1000';

CALL pin_table('/path/to/lineitem.parquet', name = 'lineitem', tier = 'gpu',
               cols = ['l_returnflag', 'l_quantity']);

-- Normal SQL reads the compressed pinned data automatically
SELECT l_returnflag, SUM(l_quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM read_parquet('/path/to/lineitem.parquet')
GROUP BY l_returnflag
ORDER BY l_returnflag;

CALL unpin_table('lineitem');
```

Use `tier = 'host'` to pin compressed data in host memory. For other datasets, point the plan
directory at plans matching your table schemas. A plan file must match the pinned table's
`name` (for example, `lineitem.txt`) and contain one column plan per full-table column in schema
order. Tables without a matching plan, small batches, and batches with insufficient compression
savings remain uncompressed. To change whether an existing pin is compressed, unpin and pin it
again. Restart the process when changing a previously loaded compression plan.

From Python, execute the same SQL with `con.execute(...)` after loading the extension and before
querying. See the [compressed pinning guide](super-sirius/compressed-pinning.md) for plan selection
and tuning.

## Configuration

Sirius loads its settings from a YAML config file, searched in this order:

1. Path in the `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable
2. `./sirius.yaml` (current working directory)
3. `~/.sirius/sirius.yaml`

If no config file is found, built-in defaults apply (95% GPU memory, 8 GiB pinned host memory per NUMA node). See the [Configuration reference](super-sirius/configuration.md) for all options: memory tiers, thread pools, operator parameters, and runtime `SET` variables. An example config is provided at [`test/cpp/integration/integration.yaml`](../test/cpp/integration/integration.yaml).

## Logging
Sirius uses [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging messages during query execution. Default log directory is `log` (relative to the current working directory) and default log level is `info`.

Log directory and level can be initialized via environment variables before loading the extension:
```bash
export SIRIUS_LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs
export SIRIUS_LOG_LEVEL=trace
```

Both can also be configured at runtime via DuckDB's `SET` command:
```sql
SET sirius_log_dir = '/path/to/logs';
SET sirius_log_level = 'trace';
SET sirius_log_flush_seconds = 1;
```

## Tracing
> **Note:** Tracing is experimental and the telemetry schema may change.

Sirius instruments query execution with [Quent](https://github.com/rapidsai/quent), emitting
per-query traces of operator and pipeline activity that Quent can render
as an interactive browser timeline. Enable it in your YAML config file,

```yaml
sirius:
  telemetry:
    enable_quent: true
    output_directory: telemetry_data
```

run queries, then visualize:

```bash
pixi run quent   # serves Quent UI at http://localhost:8080
```

See the [Quent Telemetry guide](super-sirius/quent-telemetry.md) for the full setup details: enabling the
exporter, per-query labeling, generating telemetry (using a TPC-H helper), and visualization.

## Limitations

Sirius is under active development. Notable current limitations include:

- **Data Type Coverage:** Sirius currently supports commonly used data types including `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `DECIMAL`. We are actively working on supporting additional data types—such as nested types.
- **Operator Coverage:** At present, Sirius supports `FILTER`, `PROJECTION`, `JOIN` (Hash/Nested Loop/Delim), `GROUP-BY`, `ORDER-BY`, `AGGREGATION`, `TOP-N`, `LIMIT`, and `CTE`. We are working on adding more advanced operators such as `WINDOW` functions and `ASOF JOIN`, etc.

For a full list of current limitations and ongoing work, please refer to our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/sirius-db/sirius/issues). **If these issues are encountered when running Sirius, Sirius will gracefully fallback to DuckDB query execution on CPUs.**
