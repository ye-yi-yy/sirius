# TPC-H SF1000 reproduction — 8.180 s on GB300

Reproduces an **8.180 s** TPC-H SF1000 suite (22 queries, best-of-3, 22/22 byte-identical),
against a **15.99 s** starting point — **−48.8%**.

Measured 2026-08-01 on `pmgb300ws-0163`: GB300, 152 SMs, 256 GB HBM, 72-core Grace aarch64,
driver 595.58.03, CUDA 13.2.

This branch is for reproduction only. It is not proposed for merge, and several changes here
are deliberately not PR-ready (see *Status* at the bottom).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Sirius
git clone https://github.com/felipeblazing/sirius.git && cd sirius
git checkout repro/sf1000-8.5s
git submodule update --init --recursive     # NOT automatic; required
pixi run make

# 2. Patched libcudf (clones felipeblazing/cudf @ perf/sirius-sf1000-repro)
pixi run bash bench/sf1000-repro/build-libcudf.sh

# 3. Run
DATA=/path/to/tpch_parquet_sf1000 pixi run bash bench/sf1000-repro/run.sh
```

For the TPC-H **official power/throughput run** (RF1/RF2 refresh functions, Power@Size /
Throughput@Size / QphH@Size) with this same performance stack, use `run-power.sh` — it runs on a
native `.duckdb` dataset (the MVCC refresh path needs it) with the mixed-tier pin layout in
`pin-layout-sf1000.json`. Measured 2026-08-11 (SF1000, 7 streams, GPU-vs-CPU validation PASS
after both refresh functions): **Power@Size 7,165,616 · Throughput@Size 4,951,261 ·
QphH@Size 5,956,411**.

```bash
pixi run bash test/tpch_performance/generate_tpch_refresh.sh 1000 9   # one-time refresh sets
DB=/path/to/tpch_sf1000.duckdb pixi run bash bench/sf1000-repro/run-power.sh
```

### run-power.sh knobs

All knobs are environment variables with working defaults; extra arguments after the script name
are forwarded to `tpch_power_throughput.py` verbatim (e.g. `--scratch-db`, `--update-set-offset`,
`--no-staged-refresh`).

| knob | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `both` | `power` \| `throughput` \| `both` — which phases to run and score. |
| `QUENT` | `0` | `1`: capture Quent telemetry via a derived config (`enable_quent`, per-run `QUENT_DIR`). Adds a small per-query overhead — leave off for record attempts. The GPU-pool probe stays on the original config so the capture never sees a second same-named engine. |
| `NSYS` | `0` | `1`: run under nsys with per-query cudaProfilerApi repeat ranges (`--nsys-per-query`), reports + `nsys_manifest.json` under `NSYS_DIR`. Analysis runs only — never quote nsys-wrapped scores. Incompatible with `ROLLBACK=1`. |
| `SANITIZER` | unset | `memcheck` \| `initcheck` \| `racecheck` \| `synccheck`: wrap the workload in `compute-sanitizer` (report in `SANITIZER_LOG`, exit code 99 on findings). Diagnostic runs only — 10–40× kernel overhead; never quote scores. Incompatible with `NSYS=1`. |
| `ROLLBACK` | `0` | `1`: append `--rollback-scratch` and delete `<scratch>.wal` after the run — refresh mutations stay in the WAL, so discarding it restores the scratch DB to content-pristine without a 440 GB re-copy. Requires passing `--scratch-db <path>` in the forwarded args. |
| `PROBE_TRIES` | `20` | Attempts (60 s apart) of the GPU-pool probe before giving up. On a shared box the pool reservation fails for minutes after another workload exits (lazy driver reclaim) — the failing LOAD itself is the only reliable gate; nvidia-smi lies. |
| `SF`, `DB`, `REFRESH` | SF1000 paths | Scale factor, native `.duckdb` input, refresh-set directory. |
| `CUDF_SO`, `PLANS`, `LAYOUT`, `CFG` | repro-kit paths | Optional patched libcudf to `LD_PRELOAD` (unset = pixi-provided, like `run.sh`), compression-plan dir, pin-layout JSON, Sirius config YAML. |
| `SIRIUS_PRE_SQL` | `ast_jit` SET | SQL run after `LOAD`, before any pin; override for diagnosis runs (e.g. append a log-level SET). |

### Diagnostics: sanitizer sweeps and concurrency gates

Two ready-made verification gates drive `run-power.sh` in diagnostic configurations. Both
refuse to start while foreign GPU work is running (`nvidia-smi` check), serialize against each
other via `flock` on a lease file, and append one PASS/FAIL line per run to `VERIFY-LEDGER.txt`.

- **`verify-memcheck-sf1.sh [tool] [streams]`** — compute-sanitizer sweep on a small-scale
  *concurrent* repro: SF1 data, `MODE=both`, 3 streams, and `sirius-sf1-memcheck.yaml`, whose
  tiny GPU cap (`usage_limit_fraction: 0.010`) makes the SF1000 downgrade/eviction churn regime
  fire at SF1 sizes. The sanitizer's 10–40× overhead is irrelevant at seconds scale, and every
  invalid device access self-identifies with a device PC + host allocation/free backtraces —
  this exact gate caught an out-of-bounds shared-memory read inside a vendored CCCL 3.4.0
  `DeviceScan` kernel in a single pass.
- **`verify-poison-concurrent.sh [tag] [streams]`** — full-scale SF1000 concurrent gate
  (`sirius-sf1000-gate.yaml`: 0.80 usage cap, heavier downgrade churn than production) with
  CUDA exception coredumps enabled (`CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION` + friends), so the
  first kernel to touch bad memory is captured red-handed rather than a downstream victim.
  It exports `SIRIUS_POISON_FREES=1`, an env-gated engine debug mode that ships separately
  (memory-hardening PR); without it the script degrades gracefully to a concurrent stress
  gate with coredump capture.

| 8 | orderkey entropy tail → `bitpack` | **−6.98% suite**, 9 queries ≥3% (q4 −19.7%, q5 −17.4%, q21 −14.2%, q18 −9.9%) | `plans/` only |
| | cuDF memcpy 2 MiB threshold | q9 −5.8% | `felipeblazing/cudf` `9af88b0` |

| 10 | `cuco` set bucket size 1 → 4 | −1.32% suite (q18 −3.4%, q17 −12.3%) | `sirius_dynamic_in_list_filter.cu` |
| | cuDF groupby shmem replication | q1 ~−5% | `felipeblazing/cudf` `7375a46` |

### Two latent defects in dependency fast-path selection

Both of the last wins were structures silently falling off a fast path, not tuning.

**The Bloom filter was doing a 64-bit integer modulo per probe.** `blocks_for()` sizes every
Bloom above `cuco::arrow_filter_policy`'s 128 MiB cap, so it always fell through to
`default_filter_policy`, whose `block_index` is literally `hash % num_blocks`. GPUs have no
integer-divide instruction, so that is a long emulated sequence and it dominated the kernel. The
miss is by a hair — the Arrow cap is **67.1M keys** at 16 bits/key and q21's two hot filters hold
**73.2M and 70.6M**, over by 9% and 5%. Replacing `block_index` with Lemire fast-range
(`(hash * num_blocks) >> 64`, one `mul.hi.u64`) is **q21 −15.2%**. `cuco::static_set` already
avoided this via `fast_int` magic reciprocals — only the Bloom policy was raw.

**Hash bucket size is right at 4 for one probing scheme and wrong for the other.** Our IN-list set
is **double-hashed**, so every probe step is a fresh random sector and a wider bucket retires up to
4 dependent fetches in one — measured 1.16–1.64x at real build sizes, with bucket **8 regressing**.
cuDF's *groupby* set uses **linear probing** with `step_size = BucketSize`, so successive steps walk
contiguous slots and a wider bucket only adds load — measured monotonically worse, bucket 1 optimal.
Same constant, opposite answer. **The probing scheme decides it, not the constant.**

### Plan selection: decode throughput beats ratio

The largest plan-level win was replacing the entropy tail on `l_orderkey`/`o_orderkey`
(`delta -> ans` at 626 GB/s, `delta -> lz4` at 740 GB/s) with `delta -> bitpack` at ~1500 GB/s.
Worth **−6.98% suite**, and GPU peak went *down* 2.2 GB — the entropy coders were paying for
scratch, so the lower nominal ratio cost nothing.

The campaign's original plan-selection rule was *"max ratio with decompress >= 250 GB/s"*. For
GPU-resident data that optimises the wrong variable: once the data fits in HBM, ratio buys nothing
and decode throughput is everything. The same reasoning applies to `l_shipinstruct`, kept as a
`dictionary` plan here specifically so the decode-time predicate pushdown can answer from its keys.

`l_comment` and `o_clerk` still carry entropy tails, and that is fine — **no TPC-H query references
either column**, so per-query pinning never decodes them.

### The single most valuable line

`SET expression_evaluator_strategy = 'ast_jit'` is **−4.17% for zero code**. Sirius already
dispatches to `cudf::compute_column_jit` (`expression_evaluator.cpp:222-226`) but defaults to the
interpreted AST walker. Nothing in the repo recorded it ever being measured.

The JIT kernel cache persists to disk (`$HOME/.cudf/$VERSION/$ARCH`, override with
`LIBCUDF_KERNEL_CACHE_PATH`), so the ~19 s of first-run NVRTC compilation is one-time per
`(expression, sm arch, nvrtc version)` and survives process restart — measured: suite-wide
first-iteration cost fell 28.99 s → 10.50 s on a warm cache.

## Prerequisites

- **SF1000 TPC-H parquet**, one directory per table (`lineitem/*.parquet`, …). Generate with
  `test/tpch_performance/generate_test_data.py`.
- **~256 GB GPU.** Peak usage is **251.7 GB of 256 GB**. There is under 2 GB of headroom; this
  will not run on a smaller card without lowering `scan_task_batch_size` and re-tuning.
- **~470 GB host RAM** for the host memory pool (`capacity_bytes` in the YAML).
- The pixi environment (`pixi run …`). Do not use a bare `build/release/duckdb` — see *Gotchas*.

---

## Gotchas that cost us real time

**`LD_PRELOAD`, never `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.** The Sirius extension `.so` carries `DT_RPATH`, which
the loader searches *before* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Using the latter silently loads the pixi libcudf
and your patches do nothing. Verify with `LD_DEBUG=libs` that only the custom lib initialises.

**Never pass a bare `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=` to the cuDF build.** It clobbers conda's `$CXXFLAGS`,
dropping `-isystem $CONDA_PREFIX/include`; CMake then strips rmm's include dir as "redundant"
because it is still cached in `CMAKE_CXX_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, and 17 CXX files fail with
`rmm/cuda_stream_view.hpp: No such file`. Always append (`"$CXXFLAGS -isystem …"`).
`build-libcudf.sh` does this correctly.

**`l_shipinstruct` must stay `dictionary` in `plans/lineitem.txt`.** The decode-time predicate
pushdown resolves q19's equality against the dictionary keys. If that column is switched to
`identity`, the pushdown has nothing to answer from and silently no-ops — costing q19 ~21% and
~78 GB of GPU peak.

**A GPU-vs-CPU check on an *in-memory* DuckDB compares CPU to CPU.** Sirius rejects the scan
("requires a single-file block manager") and both arms fall back, so the outputs match trivially.
Use a file-backed DB *and* assert positively that the GPU path ran.

**Custom vs shipped libcudf are not SASS-identical.** `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=NATIVE` on GB300
yields `sm_103a` only; the conda package ships sm_75/80/86/90a/**100**/120/120a with no sm_103 and
no PTX, so stock Sirius runs sm_100 SASS on this device. Measured difference is inside the ±1.2%
noise band, but **A/B any cuDF patch against a control built from the unmodified fork**, never
against conda-libcudf numbers. Use `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=100-real` to match the prebuilt.

**Measurement noise.** Suite-level is ~±1.2%. Per query, q1/q6/q9/q13/q18/q21 hold to ±1.7%
across runs, but **q7/q8/q10/q19 swing 13–28%** even at best-of-3 — the variance is between runs
(pinning order, allocator layout), not between iterations, so more iterations will not help.
Do not read a small-query delta under ~20% as signal.

## Knobs that were swept and measured inert

Do not spend time retuning these on this machine:

| knob | tested | result |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline.num_threads` | 6 / 8 / 12 | all within 0.55% |
| `hash_partition_bytes` | 16GB vs 32GB | −0.06% |
| `scan_manager.num_threads` | 18 vs 24 | −0.33% |
| `scan_task_batch_size` | 2GB | +0.10% |
| `scan_task_batch_size` | 10GB | +0.19% vs 8GB, and costs q9 2.6% |
| `mark_join_build_switch_ratio` | 3.0 / 0 (default 8.0) | −0.03% / −0.28% — never fires |
| `dynamic_filter_keep_threshold` | 0.5 / 0.2 (default 0.9) | −0.11% / +0.69% — gate never binds |
| `max_broadcast_join_size` | 8GB (default 256MB) | −0.24% |
| `enable_dynamic_zone_map_filter` | true (default false) | +0.06% — scattered keys prune nothing |
| `enable_dynamic_filter` | **false** | **LIVELOCKS** — see below |

**Do not disable dynamic filter pushdown.** At 251 GB of a 256 GB card it is load-bearing for
*memory feasibility*, not speed: without it more rows survive the scan, intermediates grow, the
executor cannot get a reservation, and it spins on `reschedule (retry 1/100)` forever with the GPU
at 0% utilisation. Twelve knobs were swept in total and **only `scan_task_batch_size` mattered**.

**GPU-busy is 91–97% of wall.** Scheduling and parallelism knobs cannot help; only removing work
or raising achieved bandwidth moves the clock. That also explains why a lookahead scheduler, a
CONCAT-barrier overlap, decompression prefetching, and a BUILD_PROBE probe-side split all measured
neutral and were dropped.

---

## Validation

- **22/22 byte-identical** across every run, against a saved reference.
- **Independent oracle**: GPU vs DuckDB CPU on SF10 parquet, same binary, compared as sorted
  multisets. 22/22 — q1 differs only in printed precision (max relative difference 1.388e-16,
  below double epsilon).

Note the byte-identical check is *self-referential* — it proves the stack did not change behaviour,
not that the behaviour is correct. The DuckDB-CPU comparison is the real oracle.

---

## Status

Reproduction branch, not merge-ready. Specifically:

- The three cuDF patches live on a fork and are not proposed upstream.
- `ast_jit` is set per-run rather than as a default; two queries (q19, q22) regressed under it in
  isolation, though both recovered in combination — that interaction is unresolved.
- The project's own unit and SQLLogic suites have **not** been run against this stack.
- Nothing in the repo's tests crosses the 1M-row gate that the q16 change depends on, so that path
  is covered only by an ad-hoc GPU-vs-CPU harness.
