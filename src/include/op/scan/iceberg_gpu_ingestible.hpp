 * @brief Parquet ingestible that applies Iceberg deletes to each decoded batch.

 * Only two things differ from the base:
 *
 * 1. @ref create_batch_coalescer forces reader-side pushdown off for every split. Positional
 *    deletes are keyed on a row's position within its file, so rows dropped during decode make
 *    the mapping unrecoverable. The predicate still runs, in @c post_filter_and_project, after
 *    the deletes — the order Iceberg requires. Row-group PRUNING stays on: it only removes rows
 *    the predicate could not match, and the footer still gives the survivors' offsets.
 *
 * 2. @ref materialize_metadata_to_table decodes through the base, then applies the pipeline.
 *
 * Equality deletes are declined by the planner: they need their key columns force-projected.
