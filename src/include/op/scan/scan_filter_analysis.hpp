/**
 * @brief Digest @p filters into the decode-time work it can support.
 *
 * Ranges recognize constant comparisons (<, <=, >, >=, =) and AND-trees of them
 * on DATE / DECIMAL(≤18) / signed- and small-unsigned-integer columns,
 * intersecting all conjuncts into one inclusive range per column. Strict
 * inequalities tighten by one; a decimal constant finer than the column's scale
 * is floored or ceiled on the side that cannot drop a surviving row.
 *
 * One EXPRESSION_FILTER shape is recognized as well. DuckDB rewrites date
 * arithmetic such as `d <= DATE '1998-12-01' - INTERVAL '72' DAY` into
 * `CAST(d AS TIMESTAMP) <= TIMESTAMP '1998-09-20 00:00:00'`, so the scan
 * receives a comparison between a cast of the DATE column and a timestamp
 * constant instead of a plain constant comparison. For DATE columns, the five
 * comparison ops, either operand order, and every timestamp flavor except
 * TIMESTAMP_TZ, the constant is converted into a bound on the stored day
 * count: midnight of day d is d * ticks_per_day, so a constant that is itself a
 * midnight names one day, and any other instant falls strictly between two
 * days and is rounded toward the side that keeps the predicate exact. Because
 * the bound is exact, coverage stays full and the residual filter is dropped.
 * DATE +/-infinity rows and +/-infinity constants compare correctly too, since
 * both domains put infinity beyond every finite value. Dates too far from the
 * epoch to be a timestamp at all make DuckDB raise an error; a decode range
 * cannot raise, so those rows are kept or dropped by the instant they denote
 * (see lower_timestamp_to_days in the .cpp). TRY_CAST is refused because it
 * yields NULL instead of raising there, and TIMESTAMP_TZ because its midnight
 * depends on the session time zone; both keep the residual filter.
 *
 * Filters that do not restrict the emitted rows are skipped WITHOUT clearing
 * coverage — OPTIONAL_FILTER and IS_NOT_NULL, which
 * @ref convert_table_filters_to_expression also drops, and @p
 * skip_primary_indices (hive partitions, enforced at file-list level). Any other
 * unconvertible conjunct clears only @c ranges_cover_whole_filter.
 *
 * Equality sets are collected only for @p filter_only_primary_indices.
