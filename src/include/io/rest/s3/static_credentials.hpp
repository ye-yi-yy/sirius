/**
 * @brief Credentials snapshot consumed by @c sirius_sigv4_presigned_authorizer's
 *        constructor (and other static-creds-based authorizers).
 *
 * Long-lived creds (typical SET s3_access_key / s3_secret_key flow): leave
 * @c session_token empty and @c expires_at @c nullopt.
 *
 * Temporary creds (STS AssumeRole / IMDS / SSO): populate @c session_token;
 * set @c expires_at when the source can report it. The static provider treats
 * @c expires_at as informational; future refresh-aware providers (downstream)
 * may use it to schedule re-acquisition.
 *
 * This is a pure POD by design: integration code constructs it from
 * @c object_store_config string fields, hands it to the authorizer's
 * constructor, and the authorizer holds an internal copy. There is no public
 * accessor on @c s3_request_authorizer to read these back — the seam exposes
 * only @c authorize() (see @c s3_request_authorizer.hpp).
