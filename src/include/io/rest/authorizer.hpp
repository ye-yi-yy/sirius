/**
 * @brief Pluggable S3 request authorizer (credential / signer seam).
 *
 * Lets downstream projects plug in their own credential / signer
 * implementation (AWS SDK presigner, internal auth broker, IMDS-backed STS
 * chain, SSO, ...) without forcing Sirius to depend on @c aws-sdk-cpp.
 * Sirius ships @c sirius_sigv4_presigned_authorizer as the default impl using
 * the existing hand-rolled SigV4 over @c static_credentials.
 *
 * The public surface is intentionally a single @c authorize() call — there is
 * no @c get_credentials() method. Implementations that lack raw key material
 * (signed-URL services, broker-issued URLs) compose cleanly. @c authorize
 * returns the URL to fetch plus the headers to attach: presigned authorizers
 * return a query-signed URL with empty headers, while header-signing
 * authorizers return a plain URL plus the signed Authorization / x-amz-*
 * headers.
 *
 * @par Lifetime
 *   Implementations should be safe to share across threads via @c shared_ptr.
 *   Backends call @c authorize() once per request, inline at the call site
 *   that issues the underlying HTTP request. Never call at scan-task creation
 *   time — presigned URLs carry an expiration and may become invalid before
 *   the deferred task runs.
 *
 * @par Errors
 *   Implementations throw @c sirius::io::credential_error on credential /
 *   signing failure. Backends translate into the broader IO error path.
