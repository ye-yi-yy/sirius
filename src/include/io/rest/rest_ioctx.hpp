 * @brief RESTful object-store (s3://) ioctx. Specialisation of
 *        @c templated_ioctx<rest_reactor>.
 *
 * Owns a pool of @c rest_reactor workers (round-robined by the base) that share
 * one @p authorizer.  Overrides @c create_io_object to resolve an object's size
 * via a blocking HEAD before constructing the @c rest_io_object — the static
 * reactor factory cannot do this since it needs the authorizer + a round-trip.
