 * @brief OOM policy that attempts to recover from fragmentation before giving up.
 *
 * When an allocation fails, this policy checks whether the CUDA memory pool is
 * fragmented (i.e., reserved memory significantly exceeds used memory). If so,
 * it trims the pool to release fragmented free blocks back to the driver, then
 * retries the allocation. If the retry also fails, the original exception is
 * rethrown.
