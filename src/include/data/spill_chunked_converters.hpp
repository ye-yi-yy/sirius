/**
 * @brief Replace the builtin monolithic GPU->HOST spill converter with a chunked one.
 *
 * The builtin cucascade fast converter collects every column buffer's D2H copy and submits
 * them in one batched call followed by one blocking synchronize, so a multi-GB spill is a
 * single monolithic submission. The chunked replacement produces a byte-compatible
 * host_data_representation (same column_metadata layout, restored by the unchanged builtin
 * HOST->GPU converter) but submits the copies in ~chunk_bytes pieces as the column tree is
 * walked, so the DMA engine works on chunk k while chunk k+1 is still being collected.
 *
 * The HOST->GPU restore direction stays on the builtin converter: it reconstructs from the
 * self-describing column_metadata, so overriding it doubles the correctness surface for
 * little gain.
 *
 * @param registry    The converter registry to modify (the builtin pair must already be
 *                    registered and the registry must not yet be published).
 * @param chunk_bytes Copy submission granularity. 0 keeps the builtin converter.
