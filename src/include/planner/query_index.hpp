/**
 * @brief Precomputed structural index over a query's pipeline DAG.
 *
 * The index partitions the pipeline DAG into linear "branches" following consumer (downstream)
 * edges. A branch is cut at a multiport consumer operator (fan-in, e.g. a join/merge whose source
 * operator has more than one input port); the multiport pipeline starts a *new* branch, so
 * pipeline_order branches are disjoint. barrier_order relaxes this: a branch reaching a multiport
 * consumer through a PIPELINE/PARTIAL-barrier port is extended past the operator into the
 * downstream pipeline (only FULL barriers cut). The chosen strategy is set via build_index_options.
 *
 * Example (numbers are pipelines; the operator merging into 4 is multiport):
 *   1 -> 2 -> 3 --[FULL]-->  4        5 -> 6 --[PIPELINE]--> 4        4 -> 7 -> 8
 * pipeline_order branches: [1,2,3], [5,6], [4,7,8].
 * barrier_order  branches: [1,2,3], [5,6,4,7,8]   (the PIPELINE edge extends 5,6 through 4,7,8).
 *
 * Branches are stored in plan order (by the head pipeline's position in the query's execution
 * order), so earlier branches sit closer to the scans. Callers use this order to assign
 * scheduling priority: earlier branch => higher priority.
