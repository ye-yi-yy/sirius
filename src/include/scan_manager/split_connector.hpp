/**
 * @brief Bridge between a scan-side producer (the scan manager) and a scan source operator.
 *
 * The connector is a lock-protected queue of pre-built splits. The producer side enqueues
 * splits as they become ready and calls close() when no more will arrive. The consumer
 * pulls splits via get_next_split(), which BLOCKS until either a split is available or
 * the connector has been closed and drained:
 *
 *   - returns std::nullopt           → connector is closed and drained, no more will arrive.
 *   - returns a non-null unique_ptr  → next split.
 *   - throws                         → producer surfaced an error via close(exception_ptr)
 *                                       and the queue is drained.
 *
 * Pushes are gated: only @ref split_provider may enqueue splits (via the
 * @c friend relationship and @ref split_provider::push_to_connector helper).
 * close() and the consumer-side methods remain public so the scan manager
 * (driver loop) and the scan operator can drive the lifecycle.
