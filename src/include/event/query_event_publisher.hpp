/**
 * @brief Observer of where a query is in its execution, assembled from the
 *        points at which work is created, dispatched, and runs out.
 *
 * The task creator and the task scheduler each see one half of the picture: the
 * creator knows what work exists and why it could not make more, the scheduler
 * knows what got dispatched and when a GPU went hungry.  Neither can say on its
 * own whether a query is scan-bound, waiting on a barrier, or simply done.
 * Reporting both halves here is what lets that be answered in one place.
 *
 * Reporters call the @c publish_* entry points, which build the event once and
 * hand a reference to it to every registered subscriber's queue.  Publishing is
 * therefore a push and never a callback: a reporter is never made to wait on
 * what a subscriber does with the event, which matters because these are raised
 * from the creator, scheduler and executor hot paths.  Nothing here is virtual:
 * the publisher is the fixed relay and the subscriber is the extension point.
 *
 * Ordering: events published by one reporter reach a subscriber in the order
 * that reporter raised them.  Across reporters the order is UNSPECIFIED --- two
 * threads can take their event IDs and then enqueue in either order, and the
 * underlying queue does not order across producers either.  @c event_id is the
 * ordering key; a subscriber that needs a global sequence must sort by it
 * rather than trust arrival order.
 *
 * Registration is not a public entry point of this class.  A @ref
 * query_event_subscriber registers itself in its own constructor and drops
 * itself in its own destructor, and nothing else needs to touch the routing
 * table --- so those two operations are private and only that friend can reach
 * them.  Callers hold a subscriber, not a mailbox.
 *
 * Lifetime: constructed by SiriusContext into a @c shared_ptr and handed to its
 * reporters by reference, each of which extends it via @c shared_from_this ---
 * so a reporter's handle is never null and never dangles.  Queues are owned by
 * their subscribers and only referenced here, so the publisher never keeps a
 * subscriber alive.
 *
 * Thread safety: the queue set is guarded by a shared mutex.  Publishing takes
 * it shared, so the reporting threads do not serialise against each other;
 * registration and deregistration take it exclusively.
