/**
 * @brief Receives the execution-stage events a @ref query_event_publisher
 *        publishes, on a thread of its own.
 *
 * The subscriber registers a mailbox in its constructor and drops it in @ref
 * stop, which its destructor calls.  In between, @ref start puts a worker on
 * that mailbox.  Events published before @ref start ACCUMULATE in the mailbox
 * and are replayed when the worker comes on; events published after @ref stop
 * are dropped at the publisher, because the mailbox is closed.  There is one
 * subscription per subscriber, and its lifetime is the subscriber's own.
 *
 * The hooks below run on the subscriber's worker, not on the creator,
 * scheduler or executor thread that raised the event, so an implementation is
 * free to do real work in them and cannot stall execution by doing so.  The
 * flip side is that a hook is a report of something that already happened and
 * may no longer be true by the time it is read.  Implementations should treat
 * the arguments as a snapshot rather than as live state.
 *
 * Thread safety: hooks are called from the subscriber's worker and nowhere
 * else, so they are serialised against each other.  They still race against the
 * implementation's own public API, which is called from elsewhere.  @ref start
 * and @ref stop may be called concurrently from any thread.
 *
 * Subclassing: the worker dispatches into virtual hooks, so it must be stopped
 * before the derived part of the object is destroyed.  A derived class whose
 * destructor can run while events are in flight must call @ref stop itself
 * --- the base destructor is too late, the derived members are already gone
 * by then.
