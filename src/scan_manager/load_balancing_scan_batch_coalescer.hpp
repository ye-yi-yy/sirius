/**
 * @brief Pipeline-ordered sequencer for @c fadvise(opportunistic) calls.
 *
 * Each pipeline registers a per-pipeline slot (a @c metadata_processing_state)
 * holding a blocking queue its split provider feeds and the coalescer,
 * balancer and connector used to place and forward the resulting splits.  A
 * single sequencer task drains the slots in the order they were registered,
 * coalescing each pipeline's splits, choosing a device, issuing the
 * @c fadvise(opportunistic) / prefetch hints and pushing onto the connector,
 * advancing to the next slot only after the current one signals closure.  This
 * serialises the opportunistic fadvise tier across pipelines so the prefetching
 * cache receives ranges in execution order rather than in
 * metadata-scan-completion order — giving the cache its longest possible lead
 * time for the head-of-line pipeline before later pipelines start competing for
 * the buffer pool.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - scan_manager calls @c register_pipeline(scan_op, balancer) once per
 *     pipeline that needs opportunistic prefetching; the returned slot pointer
 *     drives that pipeline's splits.  Its split provider is wired up via
 *     @c get_split_provider_bridge (live metadata scan) or
 *     @c use_cached_entries_for_pipeline (cached-batch replay).
 *   - scan_manager calls @c spawn_workers(dispatcher) once, after all slots
 *     have been registered, to launch the sequencer task.  The task processes
 *     slots in registration order until either all slots are drained or the
 *     stop_token fires.
