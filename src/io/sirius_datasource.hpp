 * @brief Concrete @c io_datasource backed by io_uring.
 *
 * Thin delegate: every read method forwards to @c ioctx, passing the
 * owned @c io_object by reference.
 *
 * Ownership model: one scan owns one @c sirius_datasource.  The underlying
 * @c io_object can be shared across multiple datasources (e.g. when
 * the same file is scanned in different pipelines), but the datasource
 * itself stores per-scan state (notably the @c cache_handle returned
 * by an @c fadvise call) and is therefore not safe to share.
