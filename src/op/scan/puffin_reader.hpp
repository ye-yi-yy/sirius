/**
 * @brief Read a V3 deletion vector from a Puffin sidecar file.
 *
 * Validates the Puffin footer's blob descriptor against @p ref before decoding: the spec requires
 * `content_offset`/`content_size_in_bytes` to match the descriptor's `offset`/`length` exactly, so
 * an entry pointing at another entry's vector is rejected instead of deleting the wrong rows. Then
 * verifies the deletion-vector-v1 magic and CRC-32 and deserializes the 64-bit Roaring bitmap.
 *
 * @return Sorted vector of deleted row positions (int64_t).
 * @throws std::runtime_error on I/O errors, a descriptor that contradicts @p ref, magic mismatch,
 *         or CRC failure.
