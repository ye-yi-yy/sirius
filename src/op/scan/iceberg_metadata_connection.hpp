/**
 * @brief The one place Sirius opens a DuckDB connection to read Iceberg metadata while planning.
 *
 * ## Why a connection at all
 *
 * Iceberg metadata lives behind `duckdb-iceberg`'s table functions. Sirius does not link against
 * that extension, and the facts it needs are not readable from the bound plan: `MultiFileBindData`
 * exposes no snapshot, and `OpenFileInfo::extended_info` carries only file_size/etag/last_modified/
 * first_row_id/sequence_number. duckdb-iceberg DOES install a `get_bind_info` hook
 * (`IcebergBindInfo`), and it holds the resolved `IcebergMultiFileList` when it runs, but it
 * publishes only the catalog entry -- the snapshot identity it has in hand never reaches
 * `BindInfo::options`. So the delete files, the manifest entries and the data-file footers are
 * reachable only by asking DuckDB for them.
 *
 * ## Why a SECOND connection cannot see a different table than the bind did
 *
 * This was the reviewers' hazard, and it is closed by construction rather than by agreement: an
 * `iceberg_scan` with no `snapshot_from_id` is declined at plan time, so every query issued
 * through this connection names the SAME snapshot id the outer scan was bound to. A commit landing
 * mid-plan moves `current`; it does not move a pinned id. Callers that read Iceberg metadata must
 * therefore pass `snapshot_from_id` through, and there is no path here that resolves "current".
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not force settings on. A fresh connection inherits GLOBAL settings from the shared
 * `DatabaseInstance` but not session-scoped ones, so a session-level flag is MIRRORED from the
 * outer context. Forcing `unsafe_enable_version_guessing = true` here would mean Sirius reading a
 * table the user's own session refuses to read, and deciding on its behalf that a table with no
 * version hint may be guessed at. When the outer session has not enabled it, the query fails, the
 * caller's "any failure declines" rule fires, and the table is read by DuckDB instead.
