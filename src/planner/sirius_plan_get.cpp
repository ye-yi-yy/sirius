 * the dropped column and returns data the table removed, with no error and no fallback.
 *
 * With no drops N fields occupy ids 1..N, so `max > count` means an id was retired. Reads only
 * bind data, opens no files.

 * A PRE-FILTER, not the whole test: a plain ADDED column keeps the space contiguous and slips
