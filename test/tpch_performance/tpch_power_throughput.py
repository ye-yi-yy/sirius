"""TPC-H power and throughput runs for Sirius with the RF1/RF2 refresh functions.

Power run (update set 1):
    [clean pass]  RF1  ->  22-query stream 0 (timed; feeds Power@Size)  ->  RF2
                  ->  post-RF2 pass (timed; delete mask active)

Throughput run (update sets 2..N+1):
    N concurrent query streams (spec permutations 1..N) + 1 refresh stream running
    N RF1/RF2 pairs. Sirius serializes all queries on one engine-wide lock, so this
    measures throughput of concurrent submission, not overlapped execution.

--mode selects power, throughput, or both. In both mode the throughput run
continues on the same pinned database right after the power run, with no unpin or
repin, so it sees the update-set-1 rows the power run left behind. The single
modes each pin a fresh copy of the input.

--staged-refresh takes the CSV parse off the timed path: every needed update
set is pre-loaded as native staging tables during untimed prep (spec-legal —
TPC-H v3.0.1 clause 2.5.3.1 allows providing the SUT with the RF data before
the benchmark) and the timed RF1/RF2 become INSERT..SELECT plus a hash
semi-join DELETE. Default on; --no-staged-refresh restores the legacy
COPY/read_csv path.

Every stream runs the same fixed substitution parameters by default, which keeps
validation and the clean/post-RF1/post-RF2 comparison meaningful.
--vary-predicates instead runs each stream's own qgen-generated parameters from
--query-dir (see generate_tpch_queries.sh), as an official run requires;
validation is not supported there.

Metrics:
    Power@Size      = 3600 * SF / geomean(22 stream-0 query times + T_RF1 + T_RF2)
    Throughput@Size = (N * 22 * 3600 / measurement_interval) * SF
    QphH@Size       = sqrt(Power@Size * Throughput@Size)

The input must be a file-backed .duckdb with native TPC-H tables. Only pinned
duckdb-native tables get the MVCC insert-delta/delete-mask path that makes RF1/RF2
visible on the GPU. Each phase copies the input and mutates the copy, never the
original. Refresh files come from generate_tpch_refresh.sh.

Example:
    export SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE=$(pwd)/test/cpp/integration/integration.yaml
    pixi run python test/tpch_performance/tpch_power_throughput.py \
        --sf 1 --input test_datasets/tpch_sf1.duckdb \
        --refresh-dir test_datasets/tpch_refresh_sf1
