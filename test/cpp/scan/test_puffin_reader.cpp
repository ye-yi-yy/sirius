// Unit tests for the Puffin deletion-vector reader.
//
// Every iceberg fixture in this repo stores relative paths, so none of them can tell whether
// this reader handles the URIs that Apache writers actually put in manifests. It opens the file
// directly rather than through ioctx, so the scheme stripping done at the datasource
// boundary does not reach it — and a failure here does not surface as an error: the table
// declines to CPU and the V3 path merely appears never to engage.
//
// No GPU: file IO and parsing only.
